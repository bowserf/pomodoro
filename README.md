# Pomodoro üçÖ‚è≥

iOS Pomodoro application - stay focus on a task and take a break after.

### Manage your time

This application is based on the time management method called `Pomodoro`. You split your tasks in several intervals, each one lasts generaly 25 minutes, and at the end of the time, you take a small break before to start the next session [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

The name comes from the italian word `tomato` after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that the method creator used as a student.

### Design concept

The design of the application is based on a [very beautiful concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/4073004-Have-X-Tomatoes?_=1550051888886) discovered on Dribble.

Because I had no information on the features of the initial concept, I had to adapt the design to avoid having button without any action when we click on them.

List of differences:
- The police used is different
- There is no top left button
- The middle left button has been replaced by a remove timer button.


### iOS world discovery for an Android developer

After 4 years of Android development, I start to develop iOS application for the company I work for. 

It's still new for me so if you find any no iOS way to code, bad design pattern for an iOS app or if there is better way to do some things, don't hesitate to open an issue!

I continue to learn new things day after day =)
